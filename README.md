# cc-restproxy-observed

Setting up Confluent REST Proxy connected to Confluent Cloud, plus using the Metrics API and JMX to monitor usage.

This is a blend of the Observability demo from https://github.com/confluentinc/examples/tree/6.1.1-post/ccloud-observability 
and the cp-all-in-one setup https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-all-in-one/tree/6.1.1-post/cp-all-in-one-cloud
